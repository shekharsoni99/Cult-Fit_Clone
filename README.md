# Cult-fit Website

<i>
About
At Cult, we make fitness fun and easy. We have best-in-class trainers & offer group workouts ranging from yoga to Boxing. Our workouts can be done both at a cult center and at home with the help of do it yourself (DIY) workout videos.
  
This repository is about our group project for unit III construct week. We all have ordered food online from food delivery companies like Swiggy or Zomato in India. Similar to that in this project we had to build a clone of cult.fit website that provides fresh food delivery service all across the major cities in India.

We have learned so many things during this project.

2. How user login, logout & signup data is verified on a server in the backend.
3. How to create eye-catching websites apps.
4. How to fetch data from given URLs.
5. How to integrate all the pages.
